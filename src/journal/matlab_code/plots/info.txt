Simulation parameters:
---------------------

	Fixed parameters:
	----------------
	- Circular trajectory of radius 0.5 m in the XY plane.
	- Sinusoidal trajectory of amplitude 0.2 m in the Z axis.
	- Trayectories period of 10 seconds.
	- Control signals are sent to robto each 10 ms.
	- we use a ikine_pose_ur5_configuration to reduce the error of
	  the first q, ddq, ddq obtained with ikine_pose_ur5. 
	- We set ikine_pose_ur5 to just do 10 iteration and obtain pose error of 3e-5 

	Parameters to tune:
	------------------
	- Lambda: Initial value of control gain. This value was tested for: 0.5.
	- Alpha : Learning rate. This value was tested for: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8.
	- Gamma and Beta: parameters to focus optimization on position or jerk. Consider gamma+beta = 1


Observations:
------------

- Two peaks has been observed with cartesian control. This could be generated for a weird joint configuration.
- Articular control shown a good performance to reduce error in joint coordinates. However, litle error in joint space
  could generate considerable error on cartesian space. The proposed control squeme generates that the error converge to zero
  when simulation time tends to infinite.  

- The relation between first and second parameter of cost function is 1000. For this reason we scale the second parameter over 1000.
  

To Do:
-----
- Simulate for 600 seconds the articular controller with alpha 0.1, 0.5 and 0.8.
- Generate a plot that compare the performance of three values of alpha.
- Generate a plot thatn compare the measured control signal with cartesian and articular control squeme 
- Generate a plot that compare the measured angular position with cartesian and articular control squeme.
- Implement the algorithm for PD control method.

- Generate a plot that compare sliding and PD control method. [Final]

- Write journal.
